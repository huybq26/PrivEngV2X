# PrivEngV2X

A website of a project on driver's behaviors using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. With only the input data of starting location, heading, speed and accelaration in each second, this model can predict the location based on x and y direction in every second of the journey.

Developed a backend system using NodeJS, MongoDB Database and Python for a web application to receive location data continuously from a moving vehicle in real time, which will later  be processed by deep learning model and displayed on frontend map with little delay.

For demo purpose, please find your data attached in the sample_data folder.
